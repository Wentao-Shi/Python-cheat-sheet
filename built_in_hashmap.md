## Hashmap
Hashmap is implemented as dictionary in Python:
```python
a = {}
```
To add an item:
```python
a[1] = 2
```
To remove an item by key:
```python
a.pop(1) # remove key 1
```
To iterate over key-value pairs:
```python
for k, v in a.items():
    print(k, v)
```
To iterate over keys or values:
```python
for k in a.keys():
    print(k)
for v in a.values():
    print(v)
```
